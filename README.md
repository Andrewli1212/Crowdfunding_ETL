# Crowdfunding Database
## Rutgers Bootcamp Project 2 
### Group 4

This project aims to create a crowdfunding database by extracting and transforming data from Excel files and storing it in a PostgreSQL database. The project involves creating several DataFrames, exporting them as CSV files, designing the database schema, and importing the CSV data into the corresponding database tables.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. Category and Subcategory DataFrames: Extract and transform the data from crowdfunding.xlsx to create separate DataFrames for categories and subcategories. Export these DataFrames as `category.csv` and `subcategory.csv`, respectively.

2. Campaign DataFrame: Extract and transform the data from crowdfunding.xlsx to create a campaign DataFrame. The DataFrame includes information such as campaign IDs, contact IDs, company names, descriptions, goals, outcomes, backers count, launch dates, end dates, and category and subcategory IDs. Export this DataFrame as `campaign.csv`.

3. Contacts DataFrame: Extract and transform the data from contacts.xlsx to create a DataFrame for contacts. The DataFrame includes contact IDs, names, emails, and split first and last names. Export this DataFrame as `contacts.csv`.

4. Crowdfunding Database: Create a PostgreSQL database named `crowdfunding_db`. Design the table schema based on the provided ERD and the exported CSV files. Create the necessary tables with appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. Import the CSV data into the respective tables.

## Group Member Notes

- The project was very fun for a group work. We had some chellenges with the instructions and a very unusual error in importing databases in postgres. The group worked together in one screen working step by step and helping each other go through every obstacle. Teamwork was solid! **(mlucas1206)** 

- great teamwork :) **(alykrauze)**
